# 19_CrytoClustering
Challenge 19 for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp. In this assignment, we use Unsupervised Learning to analyze data
Summary of Unsupervised Machine Learning and how it's used in this analysis ...  
  
Using Python and Unsupervised Machine Learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
Steps:
- Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
- Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
- Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
- Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
- Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
